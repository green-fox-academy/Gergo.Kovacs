1.How can you generate a random number?

This number is generated by an algorithm that returns a sequence of apparently non-related numbers each time it is called. This algorithm uses a seed to generate the series, which should be initialized to some distinctive value using function srand.

example:

value= rand()%100; this means that the value is in the range of 0 to 99

But we can not get a random number because the computer use an algorithm and this is probably a masculine repetition.

Best for creating a real random number that is probably random we can use:

Srand(time(NULL)); function.

2.What is a ternary operator? How does it work?

The ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments. The first argument is a comparison argument, the second is the result upon a true comparison, and the third is the result upon a false comparison. If it helps you can think of the operator as shortened way of writing an if-else statement. It is often used as a way to assign variables based on the result of an comparison. When used correctly it can help increase the readability and reduce the amount of lines in your code.

example:

Boolean isValueBig = ( value > 100  ) ? true : false;


Boolean isValueBig;

if(  value > 100 ) { 
      isValueBig = true;
} else { 
     isValueBig = false;
}
